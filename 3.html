    If you can't imagine life without coffee, you're not alone: Ree Drummond starts every day with a cup. (She loves it so much that she just launched The Pioneer Woman coffee line!) There are so many popular types of coffee to choose from, but for Ree, cold brew is the way to go. She mastered the art of making perfect cold-brewed iced coffee at home years ago, and these days she gets growlers of the stuff from her Pawhuska, OK, shop and restaurant The Mercantile, so she can have a tall glass every morning. "To say I couldn't live without it is an understatement," she says. Her obsession is on full display at The Merc's café, which serves a bunch of different types of coffee drinks: cold brew, of course, as well as espresso-based drinks like cortados, cappuccinos, macchiatos, and more.
