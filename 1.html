    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee" target="_blank" title="wiki coffee">Coffee</a> is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans,
    the seeds of berries from certain flowering plants in the Coffea genus.
    From the coffee fruit, the seeds are separated to produce a stable, raw product: unroasted green coffee.

    <p>The seeds are then roasted, a process which transforms them into a consumable product: roasted coffee,
    which is ground into fine particles that are typically steeped in hot water before being filtered out,
    producing a cup of coffee.
