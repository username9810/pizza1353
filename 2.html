    The history of coffee dates back to centuries of old oral tradition in modern day Ethiopia, however neither where coffee was first cultivated nor direct evidence of its consumption prior to the 15th century have been found. Sufi monasteries in Yemen employed coffee as an aid to concentration during prayers.
